# Digit Recognition
Recognizes images from the MNIST data set by applying:\
in part A: multiclass perceptron classifier (multiple binary PLA classifiers trained with one-vs-all strategy)\
in part B: Softmax regression (or multinomial logistic regression)

# Try it yourself
A gui was added so now you can draw a digit and see the machine learning model in action\
You can see for yourself that some digits (especially 9) are harder to recognize than others.
